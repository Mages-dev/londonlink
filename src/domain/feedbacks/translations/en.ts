      text: "I always wanted to learn English to make communication easier on my trips. I tried taking some courses but didn't learn much. I met Jay through my sister-in-law and sister who were already taking the course and loved it. At LondonLink I felt like part of a family where friends taught me English. The classes are interactive, dynamic, and always different.",
