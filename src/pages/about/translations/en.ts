    title: "Our Philosophy",
    paragraphs: [
      "When people ask me what LondonLink's methodology is? I think we don't have one! I believe having a specific methodology can be somewhat restrictive. However, I can provide some context about how London Link was founded.",
      "After teaching at various English schools in Brazil for several years, it became increasingly clear to me that every student has a different pace and speed at which they process the information given to them.",
      "For some students, the traditional private school method of '1 lesson / 1 unit' works well. These courses have structure and purpose, serving those with well-defined regular routines. With proper guidance, students can progress. But not all students respond well to this.",
      "In fact, most students have different goals and objectives, with different timelines to achieve them. Some already have a good level of English but need improvement in specific areas. Some just need practice to avoid getting rusty.",
      "Everyone is different, so we must be adaptable. It's for these reasons among others that I created LondonLink.",

  section3: {
    title: "Our History",
    paragraphs: [
      "In May 2017, I was approached by a software development company to create a course for their employees - a course that would help them develop and improve their existing English level. Several of these students still have classes with us today.",
      "Very quickly the news spread, and soon I found myself with many other students of varying levels. Some were beginners needing structured training in basic grammar. For these students, I wrote my own book series - 'Three Lions English'. Books that didn't follow the standard format; books designed to be used alongside plenty of verbal practice.",
      "When the Covid-19 pandemic turned our world upside down and classes shifted from in-person to online, the client base grew rapidly, allowing students from all over Brazil and now Europe to have classes with us, which is why Three Lions became available in PDF format too.",
      "As more students joined, it became necessary to form a brilliant team of teachers to meet the demand, and today we have about 100 students.",
